# Overview
A simple stock or any market forecasting using LSTM (Long Short Term Memory), a type of RNN. The goal is to model time-series trends and evaluate the model's forecasting performance.

# Notes
This repo is purely for learning and comparing LSTM to other models on forecasting. (also curious of the result tbh)

# Tools
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Numpy, Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Sckit-learn
