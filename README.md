# Forecaster

A **market forecasting** notebook using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for time series prediction.

## Overview

This project explores the use of **LSTM RNNs** for stock or market data forecasting. It’s built for learning and experimentation—comparing model performance, understanding trends, and testing enhancements like technical indicators.

- Dataset: fetched from Yahoo Finance with `yfinance`
- Core tech: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn
- Organized as a Jupyter notebook (`StockForecasting.ipynb`)
