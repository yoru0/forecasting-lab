# Overview
A simple stock or any market forecasting using LSTM (Long Short Term Memory), a type of RNN. The goal is to model time-series trends and evaluate the model's forecasting performance.

# Notes
This repo is purely for learning and comparing LSTM to other models on forecasting. (also curious of the result tbh).
The dataset is taken and downloaded from yahoo finance using yfinance library.
Prolly can add indicators like moving average, bollinger bands, or fibonacci retracement to maybe get a better result from the model; or mayba can add some technical analysis algorithms??

# Tools
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Numpy, Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Sckit-learn
